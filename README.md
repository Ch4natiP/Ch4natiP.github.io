# THcoin (THC)

THcoin is an experimental digital asset designed as a long-term store of value.

## Purpose
THcoin exists to explore whether a fixed-supply, ownerless digital asset can preserve value over long periods of time in an inflationary world.

## Core Principles
- Fixed supply forever
- No promise of profit or return
- No investment, no fundraising
- No central owner or controller
- Designed to exist independently of its creator

## What THcoin Is
- A digital asset
- A store-of-value experiment
- An open and verifiable system

## What THcoin Is Not
- Not a currency
- Not an investment product
- Not a savings or yield program
- Not a payment network

## Documentation
- Website: https://ch4natip.github.io/
- Whitepaper: see `WHITEPAPER.md`

## Status
THcoin is deployed once and designed to remain unchanged.
Time, not promotion, determines its relevance.
