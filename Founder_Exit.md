# Founder Exit Statement

THcoin is designed to exist without reliance on any individual.

The founder:
- Holds no special privileges
- Has no control over supply or rules
- Cannot modify the system after deployment

After initial deployment and documentation publication, the founder withdraws from all operational roles.

No future decisions require founder approval.

If THcoin continues to exist, it does so because participants choose to use or hold it—not because of leadership, promotion, or guarantees.

THcoin is ownerless by design.
