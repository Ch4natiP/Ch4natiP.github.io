# THcoin Whitepaper v1.0

## Abstract

THcoin is an experimental digital asset designed as a long-term store of value. It is created in response to the structural risks of inflation, monetary expansion, and centralized control in modern financial systems. THcoin is not a currency, not an investment product, and does not promise any form of return.

---

## 1. Introduction

Inflation gradually erodes purchasing power over time. For many individuals, holding value in traditional forms such as cash exposes savings to long-term decline. While various assets exist as hedges, access, transparency, and trust remain challenges.

THcoin proposes a digital alternative focused purely on scarcity, transparency, and long-term survivability.

---

## 2. Design Philosophy

THcoin is built on five non-negotiable principles:

1. Fixed supply forever
2. No central owner or controller
3. No promise of profit or yield
4. System survivability without founders
5. Transparency through open verification

These principles are intentionally restrictive to prevent future manipulation.

## 3. What THcoin Is (and Is Not)

### THcoin Is:

* A digital asset
* A store-of-value experiment
* A permissionless, ownerless system

### THcoin Is Not:

* A currency
* An investment
* A savings product
* A payment system

---

## 4. Token Specification

* Name: THcoin
* Symbol: THC
* Network: Ethereum Layer 2
* Standard: ERC-20
* Total Supply: 21,000,000 THC

The total supply is minted once at deployment and cannot be increased.

## 5. Token Distribution

| Allocation              | Percentage | Conditions                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Community (Fair Launch) | 60%        | Distribution + open market |
| DAO Treasury            | 20%        | Multi-signature controlled |
| Long-term Reserve       | 10%        | Locked for 10 years        |
| Founder                 | 10%        | Locked for 10 years        |

No presale or fundraising is conducted.

---

## 6. Supply Immutability

THcoin has no minting, burning, pausing, or upgrade mechanisms. The smart contract is deployed once and remains immutable.

This ensures monetary predictability and prevents discretionary changes.

---

## 7. Governance Model

THcoin governance is conducted via a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Governance decisions are limited to:

* Ecosystem tools
* Infrastructure support
* Treasury usage

Governance cannot modify core monetary rules.

---

## 8. Founder Exit Strategy

The founder holds no special privileges. Founder tokens are time-locked for 10 years. After deployment and initial communication, the founder withdraws from operational control.

The system must function independently of any individual.

---

## 9. Risk Disclosure

THcoin carries risks, including but not limited to:

* Market volatility
* Regulatory uncertainty
* Technological risks

Participants must evaluate these risks independently.

---

## 10. Conclusion

THcoin does not attempt to promise growth or adoption. Its value proposition is simplicity: fixed supply, no control, and time.

If THcoin survives, it is because participants find value in its design—not because of promotion or guarantees.

---

THcoin is an experiment. Time is the final judge.

---

## Final Statement

THcoin was created with a single intention: to exist.

There is no roadmap beyond its fixed rules.
There is no promise of profit, adoption, or success.
There is no authority to guide, manage, or rescue it.

After publication of this document and deployment of the protocol, the creator withdraws from all roles.
No future statements, endorsements, or explanations will be provided.

THcoin will persist or disappear based solely on voluntary use.

If it survives, it survives honestly.
If it fails, it fails honestly.

Time—not people—is the final arbiter.
